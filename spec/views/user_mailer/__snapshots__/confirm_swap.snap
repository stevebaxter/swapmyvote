Hi John (test user),
</p>
<p>
Good news! Jane (test user) would like to swap their vote
and will vote for your preferred party if you vote for theirs, in
your constituency!
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://test.host/user">Click here to confirm this swap!</a>
</p>
<p>
Please confirm this swap as soon as possible, as it will
expire at latest in the next 48 hours, and
potentially sooner as we get closer to the end of the election.
Votes for your preferred party are in demand, so if you don't
confirm this swap, we may not be able to find you someone else to
swap with.
</p>
<p>
If for any reason you don't wish to swap with
Jane (test user), you can find new potential voting
partners by simply updating your info using the link that says "Not
right? Update your info". This will reset the swap, letting your
partner know it has been cancelled. You are then free to select
another voting partner from the list.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, why not share Swap My Vote with your social networks so that more people can make their vote count?
