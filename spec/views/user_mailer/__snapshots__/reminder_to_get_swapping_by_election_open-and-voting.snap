Hello John (test user),
</p>
<p>
You're signed up to Swap My Vote but you haven't found a swap
yet.  There's still time!
</p>
<p>
If you haven't been offered a swap yet or have had your offers
declined, please
<a href="http://test.host/user/review?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=reminder-get-swapping">review whether PartyB in your constituency is helpful to potential vote swap partners.</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you just haven't had time to look for a swap yet, or were waiting
for more choices,
<a href="http://test.host/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=reminder-get-swapping">visit Swap My Vote now</a>!
</p>
<p>
As it's polling day, once a swap is offered and confirmed, it isn't
possible to change it, so please offer or confirm only if you're
definitely happy with the swap.
</p>
<p>
To a better democracy,
</p>
