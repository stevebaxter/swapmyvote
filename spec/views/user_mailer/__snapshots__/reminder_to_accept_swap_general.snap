Hi John (test user),
</p>
<p>
Action needed!  You haven't yet accepted the offer from
Jane (test user)
to vote for your preferred party PartyA in
Constituency2.
</p>
<p>
Please don't keep them waiting!  Either
<a href="http://test.host/">accept their offer</a>,
or
<a href="http://test.host/">decline it</a>,
so that you can receive other offers and they can look for another
swap elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
If you accept, you agree to vote for their preferred party
PartyB in your constituency of
(Constituency1).
</p>
<p>
All the best,
<br>
