Hi John (test user),
</p>
<p>
You're all set to swap your vote with
Jane (test user)!
</p>
<p>
Jane (test user) is going to vote for your preferred party for
you, in the Constituency2 constituency.  In
return, you will vote for their preferred party in your constituency
(Constituency1).
</p>
<p>
We'll send some reminders to Jane (test user) to remind them to
vote for your chosen party, and we'll ask them for confirmation
once they have.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately Jane (test user) has not shared their
email address or social media profile.
If this makes you uncomfortable you can
<a target="_blank" href="http://test.host/faq#reset">cancel your swap</a>.

</p>
<p>
Lastly, why not share Swap My Vote with your social networks so that
more people can make their vote count?
