  - elsif poll.signed_marginal_score.positive?
    Looks like your vote may be supporting a safe win for
    = party.name
    who are currently leading by
    = percent_score
    in the polls for #{constituency.name},
    so it's less likely that people supporting
    = party.name
    will want to swap with you.
  - else
    = party.name
    are trailing by
    = percent_score
    in the polls for #{constituency.name},
    and may still lose despite this swap, so it's less likely that people supporting
    = party.name
    will want to swap with you.
